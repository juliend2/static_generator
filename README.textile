h1. Why did i create Static Generator?

Because i wanted a simple way to grab the HTML from a site generated with my Ruby on Rails CMS. 
The cool thing with StaticGenerator compared to other solutions (wget), is that when i have an URL like /home/subpage , instead
of having this file structure:

pre. /home
  /subpage.html

i have this file structure:

pre. /home
  /subpage
    /index.html

so all the links in the generated site will stay the same.

h2. Usage

pre. require 'static_generator'
crawler = StaticGenerator::Crawler.new('http://mysite.com/', {
  :destination_path => File.expand_path('some/destination/directory'),
  :url_prefix => 'http://mysite.com/'
}) 
crawler.crawl!
